# Classes that represent sketch rules and sketches
# There are two types of Sketches that consist of their corresponding sketch rules
# Expanded rules have conditions and effects in as lists of feature variables (e.g. n=5)
# Sketch rules have conditions and effects as lists of feature conditions and feature effects (e.g. nâ†“)
# Sketch rules can be expanded into expanded sketch rules when the minimum and maximum values of the used features are
# known
